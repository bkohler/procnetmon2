# ProcNetMon2 Project Summary

## Overview
ProcNetMon2 is a high-performance network monitoring tool that uses eBPF to track process-specific network statistics. The tool provides real-time insights into network usage with minimal system overhead.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. eBPF Implementation
- Use TC (traffic control) hooks for network monitoring
- Implement custom eBPF maps for efficient data collection
- Minimize context switches between kernel and user space
- Use ring buffers for efficient event processing

### 2. Process Monitoring
- Direct process metadata access via /proc filesystem
- Efficient PID validation and tracking
- Capability-based permission management
- Process lifecycle event handling

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Batch processing for statistics collection
- Ring buffer for event processing
- Memory pools for connection tracking
- Efficient map operations

### 4. Data Collection
- 1-second refresh intervals for real-time monitoring
- Sliding window for rate calculations
- Efficient protocol detection
- Connection state tracking
- Interface-specific filtering

## Technical Requirements

### System Requirements
- Linux kernel 5.5 or later (for modern eBPF features)
- LLVM/Clang for eBPF compilation
- CAP_BPF capability or root access
- Go 1.21 or later

### Dependencies
```go
require (
    github.com/cilium/ebpf v0.12.0
    github.com/spf13/cobra v1.8.0
